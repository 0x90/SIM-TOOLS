Strategy to update Sim toolkit on real operator Sim Card
========================================================

Setup a private network with MCC/MNC corresponding to sim card.
The MS must authenticate with the private network.
The MSC sends a "CIPHER MODE COMMAND" to the BSS to disable encryption.
The Library GSM0348 and Gammu combined can help to send SMS-PP download to the sim card or perhaps SMS-CB to thousands of sims 

This link explain how to setup a programmable sim card.
