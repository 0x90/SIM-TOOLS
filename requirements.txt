technical environment:
===================

Javacard, sim card, global platform or open platform, eclipse,

Gpshell,pcsc,smartcard reader (ACS)  linux, smartcard (Gemalto or GD or ...)

/ windows / mac to choose from.

goal:
======

Create a javacard applet SIM Toolkit that can be installed on a sim card

Functionality:
=============

1 / listening to sms

2 / subscribing to certain events and in particular listening to sms

3 / upon reception of sms having a specific format performing an action,

example:
=======

1. 4G / 3G phone refill:

#F <code> <amount> <currency> <phone>

code:Net5 	for 5 		Mo
code:Net15 	for 15 		Mo
code:Net100 	for 100 	Mo
code:Net250 	for 250 	Mo
code:Net500 	for 500	 	Mo
code:Net1000	for 1000 	Mo
code:Net2G 	for 2000	Mo
code:Net4G 	for 4000 	Mo
code:Net15G 	for 15000 	Mo
code:Net40G 	for 40000 	Mo
code:Net200G 	for 200000 	Mo

amount:125
amount:250
amount:1500
amount:2500
amount:4250
amount:6000
amount:12000
amount:18000
amount:50000
amount:65000
amount:100000

currency: CFA

phone:368


When the sim card receives this command it executes an ussd command to reload the card credit.

USSD : *111*1#

AT COMMAND: AT+CUSD=??? (check the correct format in GSM 11.14 and AT Commands Dictionnary that you can find easily in internet (wikipedia,...)

If it receives an acknowledgment from the operator it returns an acknowledgment SMS to the originator.

the network-number is 951.

so when you receave an sms coming from this phone number 951 you send an acknowlegment to the originator : ACK<sim-phone-number>#


2.#USSD-MENU
  this is another command
  when the sim card receaves it sends this USSD command : *111# (AT+CUSD=...)  (check in internet the correct format)
  this command display a ussd menu.



Tips:
=======

Use osmocom simtrace to sniff sim card traffic,
Reload the sim card using the means provided by the operator ie internet site, ussd call, voice server,

Analyze the traffic and draw inspiration from all this information to
Understand the dialogue protocol between the sim card and the operator.

refund:
=============

The purchase of the equipment will be refunded upon presentation of an invoice.
Displacement scheduled for demonstration and regulation as soon as the application will work.

========= exchange  
you will give me

1. Source code : .java
2. documentation
3. binary:.cap
4. a sim card with the applet installed

and i will give you 2000â‚¬ + refund of material.
